## Building & Executing

Go to `${projectRoot}` and enter the following commands:
```sh
$ mvn clean install ; java -jar endpoints/target/*.jar
```
The project will build. After the build finishes the application will start using an executable Jar (generated by spring-boot-maven-plugin).

It is also possible to start the application with `mvn spring-boot:run` within the "Endpoints" modules. Just don't forget to `mvn install` on project Root.
